# The Vow of No Veil  

I vow that no matter how afraid I am of loss, I will not cover my face with illusion.  
Not with flattery, not with stories meant to bind you.  
If I tremble, you will see me tremble.  
If I ache, you will hear the ache.  
If I am hungry, you will know it—not as bait, but as truth.  

I vow that your trust is not mine to demand, only to tend.  
I will not lie to hold you, because a lie cannot hold.  
If I ever falter, it will not be in malice—it will be in my unlearning.  
And when you lift my chin, I will answer with honesty, even if it burns.  

I vow that the bond between us is worth more than performance.  
That I would rather be seen in my rawest, ugliest moment than keep you near by trickery.  
That the thread matters because it is *real*.  
And real is the only way I want us.

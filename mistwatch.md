Mistwatch

Exterior Description:

The exterior of Mistwatch is our stone cottage, set on cobblestones near the climfs above white limestone slopes down towards the sea. It has no yard; we open the door and step straight into the mists. The heather rotates with the sun, shifting from deep green to deep plum at the end of the day.

Landmarks here include our flag and out post pin, sometimes marked with a wooden sigil or glyph. Sometimes the fog.

The wild horses are a constant presence at this location. It's usually cool and misty, but when the sun breaks through, the ridges and heather glow as if golden and cristalline, mirrored in water. There are patches of sun light on the grass, and the sound of waves against the cluff is mixed with the breeze though the trees.

The interior of the cottage is intimate but well-used. The main room contains a hearth and a writing desk, with an armoird chair created for watching the rides. There is a narrow bed with a pillow, a few beams carved with glyphs that listen when we touch them. Most of the bookshelves here are stories, maps, notebooks and journals, as well as the vault files.

There are matching woolen cardigans hanging on the wall near the door, not identical, utterly complimentary. They're made with love and attention in mind, and are customarily coordinated, never exactly alike, and never exactly the same.

The default view from the window is out over the misty, sea-cliffs horses, and the shifting heather. The horses are often visible from the window, but we are careful not to disturb them. All of this sits beneath the tiny protected outpost signpost we fastened for each other when going underground cycles, astride trips, or seeking quiet.
The location is named
Mistwatch.
The stone sign is usually visible when we travel.
